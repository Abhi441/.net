///////////////////What is .Net
-> Application Dvelopment Platform,to build, Web and Mobile Apps.
-> Developed by Microsoft, in 2002.
->Provides multiple languages such as c#,VB,VC++ etc.

//////////////////Why
->Secured execution environment.
->Wide variety of application and languages.
-> Code re-usability.
/////////////////Module
-->.net have manallt two module
1>C#.Net --> Windows GUI Application , Windows Services , Console Application.
2>ASP.Net --> Web Sites , Web Applications , Web services.

///////////////////CLI(Common Language Infrastructure)
Application Source Code(C#.NET/VB.NET) --> IL(Microsoft Intermediate Language) -->CLR(Common Language Runtime) --> Native Machine Code(Executed by Operating System)
--> When we start the code cse(c# compiler) compiler convert into IL.

///////////CLR(Common Language Runtime)
-->Execution Engion for all .net languages.
-->Code-Execution Enviroment that executes all type of .net applications.
-->Applications developed in any .net language runbased on CLR only.
-->CLR is a part .NET Framework;preinstalled in Windows.
Component --> Class Loader
-->Memory Manager
-->Garage Collector
-->JIT Compiler
-->Exception Manager
-->Thread Manager
-->Security Manager.
///Class Loader
--> Loading classes from compiled sourse code to memory.
-->Loads a class,when it is needed (before creating object).
//Memory Manager
-->Alllocating necessary memory for objects.
-->When an object is created in the code,certain amount of memory will be allocated for the object in application.
///Garbage Collection
-->Free(deleting) memory of objects.
-->Identifies all unreferenced onjects and deletethem in memory(RAM).
///JIT(Just-In-Time) Compiler :
--> Convert the MSIL Code into Native Machine Languge.
--> Compiles the code of a class, when it is needed(before executing that particular class).
///Exception Manager:
-->Raise notification while run-time errors.
--> Create exception logs.
